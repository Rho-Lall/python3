    "\n",
    "**Classify.** Classify a test group and predict survivability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correlate.** Analyse correlations among the featureset to support creating, completing, or correcting features. Which features contribute significantly to the solution? What correlations exist among features other than survival?\n",
    " \n",
    "**Convert.** Convert categorical (string objects) to numerical equivalent values as solutions require.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complete.** Estimate missing values within a feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct.** Analyze the given training dataset for errors within features to correct them or exclude the records containing the errors. Look for outliers. Discard a feature if it does not contribute to the analysis (Elective).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create.** Engineer new features from existing feature or a set of features (Elective).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chart.** Visualize the nature of the data and the solution."

    "The question: Can we [predict survival](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) on the Titanic?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1,502 out of 2,224 passengers and crew, 68%. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n",
    "\n",
    ">One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, we will analyse what people were likely to survive and predict which passengers survive the tragedy. Specifically, do these commonly held ideas holds up under analysis, that women, children, and the upper-class were more likely to survive.\n"

    "### Initial Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "I take issue with two of these features: SibSp & Parch. I can live with obscure feature names but combining data points is unforgivable. The relationship a person has with a sibling vs a spouse is different, as is the relationship with your parent versus your child. At first I accepted it, assuming this was some form of common practice. However, as I explored the data I have developed a belief that these relationships are important and should be separated out. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other analysis on this topic has allowed for an implied assumption that the Titanic's manafest is a collection of passengers. In reality it is a collection of families and should be analysed as such. I found enough variability in family dynamics that such analysis might result in new insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, I've basically line by lined this data set parsing out the family relationships into separate features. To accomplish this I engineered a feature, Family, from name (last name), & Ticket. With this information I corrected Sibsp and Parch, separating them into separate features:Sibling, Spouse, Parent, Child, & Single.\n",
    "\n",
    "I saw the need to distinguish between Family size and Ticket size. I broke name out into Title, first and last name. I also created a second dependent variable, theDead, which is simply the converse of Survived. \n",
    "\n",
    "I did all of this in Excel. There is also a feature, DataSet, which existed to maintain a separation between the training and test data while correcting the family features.\n",

    "**Correlating.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to know how well does each feature correlate with Survival. We want to do this early in our project and match these quick correlations with modelled correlations later in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Completing.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Complete Age feature as it is definitely correlated to survival.\n",
    "2. Complete the Embarked feature as it may also correlate with survival or another important feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correcting.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ticket feature was combined with last name to engineer a family group feature, Family. Some individuals traveled on the same ticket, this is captured in the feature, Family.\n",
    "2. Cabin feature will be dropped as it is highly incomplete in training and test dataset.\n",
    "3. PassengerId will be dropped from training dataset as it does not contribute to survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Created a new feature called Family based on other features to get total count of family members on board.\n",
    "2. Engineered firstName, lastName, & Title features from name.\n",
    "3. May create new feature for Age bands. This turns a continous numerical feature into an ordinal categorical feature.\n",

    "3. The upper-class passengers (Pclass=1) were more likely to have survived.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analyze by pivoting features\n",
    "\n",
    "To confirm some of our observations and assumptions, we can quickly analyze our feature correlations by pivoting features against each other. We can only do so at this stage for features which do not have any empty values. It also makes sense doing so only for features which are categorical (Sex), ordinal (Pclass) or discrete (SibSp, Parch) type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pclass** We observe significant correlation (>0.5) among Pclass=1 and Survived (classifying #3). We decide to include this feature in our model.\n",
    "- **Sex** We confirm the observation during problem definition that Sex=female had very high survival rate at 74% (classifying #1).\n",
    "- **SibSp and Parch** These features have zero correlation for certain values. It may be best to derive a feature or a set of features from these individual features (creating #1)."

Guess Age values using [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) values for Age across sets of Pclass and Gender feature combinations. So, median Age for Pclass=1 and Gender=0, Pclass=1 and Gender=1, and so on...\n",
