# DEEP LEARNING INTRO.

Traditional ML methods include two parts: 

1. One algorythm for feature extraction, 
2. & a second ML classifier.

Neural Networks optimze for both steps.

# Why GPU?
Deep Learning also requires super fast matrix computations. So researchers put two and two together and started training models in GPUâ€™s and the rest is history.

GPUs are specialized hardware originally created to render games in high frame rates. Graphics texturing and shading require a lot of matrix and vector operations executed in parallel and those chips have been created to take the heat off the CPU while doing that.

Use an NVIDIA GPU for a few reasons:

* Currently the fastest
* Native Pytorch support for CUDA
* Highly optimized for deep learning with cuDNN
